/**
 * Conventions and helpers for TANGO QA reports.
 *
 * Every test that appears in the standard QA report needs:
 *
 *   1. Ticket reference + AC clauses (verbatim text quoted from the ticket
 *      at the time the test was written) via `annotateAc(testInfo, { ... })`.
 *      Verbatim text is preserved so the report shows what AC was tested
 *      *at the time of the run* — useful when AC text drifts later.
 *
 *   2. `test.step()` wrappers around each meaningful user action. Step
 *      labels should spell out the INPUT VALUES being set (e.g.,
 *      `Fill: Name="[QA] ...", Product="Regular Rate", ...`) so someone
 *      reading the report can reproduce the test by hand.
 *
 *   3. Before/after `captureAcSnapshot(testInfo, page, ...)` calls
 *      bracketing the action that proves the acceptance criteria.
 *
 * Tests with no `test.step()` calls are dropped from the report — the
 * reporter requires at least one step to consider a test reproducible.
